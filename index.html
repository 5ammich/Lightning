		    Jeez, this cloud must be having a really bad day. Lightning will spawn intermittently to strike you down. Pressing the L key makes lightning spawn more quickly, whereas the SPACEBAR and mouse
		    allow you to control the lightning. To play a game version of this, press the J key to summon the player (YOU) and use A and D to move. 
		    The longer you survive, the more points you get.
